  <h1><b> My assignment.html page for linking to assignment items described in Assignment and Report Specifications</b></h1>
  <p><br></p>
  <p>This page is the marking guide to your website that your tutor will use to find your elements. Do not name this page anything other than assignment.html (all lower case) or else we may not be able to find and mark your assignment elements.<span>&nbsp; </span>How
    to use this page:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>upload this assignment.html file in your website directory during part 2.2.2 of Lab 1</li>
    <li>later, link this page to your website's index.html page</li>
    <li>over time, link each assignment task listed below to its location in your website as soon as you have started it</li>
    <li>replace the "notes" paragraph with your notes or delete if you have no notes - your notes will help us understand and mark your site so you should explain things. Maybe you did a task differently from the way we specified it, either because your way
      is better (tell us) or minimally or not at all to fit in with your site's look and feel (tell us) or ... (also tell us). So, for example, a video might spoil the look and feel. What you do is make one anyway, link to it from this assessment.html
      page and explain in the <i>Notes</i> why it's not linked to from your public version of your web site. You can style this page as your like, so long as you keep the links to the assignment tasks.</li>
    <li>provide details for your best student forums posts where indicated</li>
    <li>provide the date you attended the continuous improvement session where indicated</li>
    <li>provide link to report where indicated</li>
    <li>delete these instructions when you are ready</li>
  </ul>

  <h1><b>1.0 Part 1 Tasks</b></h1>
  <h2><b>1.2 Your <i>Me and My Passion</i></b></h2>
  <p>http://partch.anu.edu.au.virtual.anu.edu.au/~u6409914/index.html#work http://partch.anu.edu.au.virtual.anu.edu.au/~u6409914/index.html#blog</p>
  <p>Notes: Given the adapted theme from initial assignment requirements, the passion is equivalent to my career hence the blog post previews and previous work are equivalent to my writing about them.</p>
  <h2><b>1.3 CSS</b></h2>
  <p>http://partch.anu.edu.au.virtual.anu.edu.au/~u6409914/resources/styles/main.css</p>
  <p>Notes: Provide any notes you may have about this element here.</p>
  <h2><b>1.4 Site Map</b></h2>
  <p>http://partch.anu.edu.au.virtual.anu.edu.au/~u6409914/site-map.html</p>
  <p>Styled poorly due to lack of thought at start on how it will look on mobile etc and lack of ideas. However, it's responsive with a description of the page before you go to it. So you press the section you're interested in, the page preview will populate
    and then press go to go to the page.</p>
  <h2><b>1.5 Source Log</b></h2>
  <p>http://partch.anu.edu.au.virtual.anu.edu.au/~u6409914/source-log.html</p>
  <p>Notes: Provide any notes you may have about this element here.</p>
  <h2><b>1.6 Feedback Form</b></h2>
  <p>http://partch.anu.edu.au.virtual.anu.edu.au/~u6409914/index.html#contact </p>
  <p>Notes: Feedback form has been replaced by a contact form to ask me questions about my work or hire me due to the theme of site</p>
  <h2><b>1.7 This Assessment Page</b></h2>
  <p>http://partch.anu.edu.au.virtual.anu.edu.au/~u6409914/assessment.html</p>
  <p>Notes: Provide any notes you may have about this element here.</p>

  <h1><b>2.0 Part 2 Tasks</b></h1>
  <h2><b>2.1 Image Map</b></h2>
  <p>http://partch.anu.edu.au.virtual.anu.edu.au/~u6409914/imagemap.html</p>
  <p>Notes: I didn't want the image map to be on my main page as it would ruin the aesthetic. Therefore, I put it on another page. The image map is of a project I recently completed. The project had multiple phases, hence I thought an image detailing the
    phases which links to different parts of the page based on which phase you select would be appropriate.
  </p>
  <h2><b>2.2 Photo Gallery</b></h2>
  <p>http://partch.anu.edu.au.virtual.anu.edu.au/~u6409914/index.html</p>
  <p>Notes: The image gallery contains images of the new project I just completed.</p>

  <h2><b>2.3 & 2.4 Javascript</b></h2>
  <p>I am doing javascript </p>
  <p>Notes: I decided to go for a gallery to showcase my 'featured project' on my page</p>
  <h2><b>2.3 Javascript addition</b></h2>
  <p>http://partch.anu.edu.au.virtual.anu.edu.au/~u6409914/index.html</p>
  <p>Javascript was relevant to my use case due to the fact that this website is showcasing what I can do. So having a custom image gallery for a featured project at the top is a good way to illustrate different parts of my project without overloading my
    website's visual space with images. </p>
  <h2><b>Well written Javascript</b></h2>
  <p>http://partch.anu.edu.au.virtual.anu.edu.au/~u6409914/resources/scripts/gallery.js</p>
  <p>Notes: The script I wrote excels in the following critereon:
    <ul>
      <li><b>Portability</b> : The script is portable in the sense that you can use it on any website that has a galleryPreview, image-title and preview tiles elements. Furthermore, it doesn't need any dependencies to run which is a massive positive for portability.</li>
      <li><b>Performance</b> : The script is lightweight to reduce high resource consumption from solutions that utilize external libraries such as JQuery to run. </li>
      <li><b>Readability</b> : The script has been designed to be very readable with clear variable names, modular functions instead a string of unorganised calls. Furthermore, each function is heavily commented with a description.</li>
      <li><b>Extendability</b> : The script is extendable as I have written my functions to do basics like switching an image by index. These foundational functions make it easier to extend the script to do more as I have already done with tile generation
        for example. Additionally I am using ES6 Javascript Syntax with anonymous functions, ${} data binding and good variable etiquette with let and const where context is not relevant which should be less likely to be deprecated in the future.</li>
    </ul>

  <h1><b>3.0 Part 3 Tasks</b></h1>
  <h2><b>3.1 Reflections</b></h2>
  <p><a href="about-my-site.html">About My Site</a></p>
  <p>Notes: </p>
  <h2><b>3.2 Alternative CSS</b></h2>
  <p><a href="resources/styles/mobile.css">Mobile CSS</a></p>
  <p>
    This includes a mobile adaptation of my website's main styles. I am utilizing media queries to make the following changes to make the site mobile friendly.
    First, given my gallery is a terrible experience on a smaller screen when the screen reaches the point where it's unusable, I hide the gallery and replace it with a static image.
    Second, given screen width is rather narrow on mobile, all my content (text and tiles) stretch to be wider to make it easier to read.
    Third, the social media feeds are not condusive of a good mobile experience, given you have such little screen real estate there should be only one thing to focus on
    so as we reach mobile screen sizes they also vanish.
    Fourth, Given it's a flexbox based website, I have been able to convert all of the elements in each pane from a row layout on desktop to a column layout on mobile.
    It allows for a much nicer experience as mobile screens are not wide enough to display rows of tiles.

  <h2><b>3.3 Social Networking Button(s)</b></h2>
  <p><a href="index.html">Social Networking Buttons on Top Right of Screen in Navbar</a> </p>
  <p>Notes: Provide any notes you may have about this element here.</p>
  <h2><b>3.4 Social Networking Feed(s)</b></h2>
  <p><a href="index.html">At the bottom right of the screen, click the twitter bubble</a></p>
  <p>Notes:
    <ul>
      <li>Very proud of this one. I have developed my very own feed, including a hovering button, a back-end server utilizing REST API calls. It works very similarly to a chat window on a service like Facebook Messenger.</li>
      <li>I developed a NodeJS based backend server that stores a token and interacts with the Twitter API. It is hosted on a free Amazon Web Services host. <span style="color: darkblue"> Note : I do understand the back end is not assessable, but if you want to look at the code I wrote please contact me.</span></li>
      <li>My front end website utilizing <a href="resources/scripts/feeds.js">this script</a> requests my API to request the Twitter API for my tweets. Twitter API responds to my API which then responds to my site.</li>
      <li>After getting the API response (which is in the form of a JSON Array File), my script handles the population of the data onto my DOM. Note: the script is heavily commented given it is slightly outside of the scope of this course</li>
      <li>Additionally, I have set this up with Asynchronous Javascript, so, until I actually get a response from the server (if not I use the backup data), the buttons to access the twitter feed will not display. If both data sources fail, the user will not see the button and wonder why it's unresponsive.</li>
      <li><span style="color: darkblue">Note: I did ask for special permission to do something very similar to this from Sabrina she did say yes, but I just extended it a bit with NodeJS API and using Twitter as my source instead.</span></li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  <h2><b>3.5 CSS and HTML Validation</b></h2>
  <p><a href="validation.html">Validation Page</a></p>
  <p>Notes: Did have errors but explained and justified them on document.</p>
  <h2><b>3.6 Something Original</b></h2>
  <p>
    <a href="index.html">Github Feed (to access press button on bottom right of page)</a>
  </p>
  <p>Notes:
    <ul>
      <li>Also proud of this one. Works using the same script as my social media feeds but enables a GitHub button. When pressed, little window appears which is scrollable like a chat box. Each cell is a GitHub project I have forked/created.</li>
      <li>Each cell contains the title, description and three buttons to either view my project's readme, see the projects commits or download it. (Direct downloading works if the project is frequently downloaded)</li>
      <li>This works by interfacing with the GitHub API, pulling account data and then seeing the patterns in the view, commit and download endpoints and generating them</li>
      <li>Then the cells are populated in the feed and it's visible</li>
      <li><span style="color: darkblue">Note: I do know it may seem similar to social media feed, but this offers more functionality and GitHub is not a social media network. Furthermore, while I have tried to minimise code redundancy by having shared functions like populate cell there is a significant amount of extra code that went into GitHub as is evident in the script.</span></li>
  </ul>
