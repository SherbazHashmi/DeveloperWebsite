  <h1><b> My assignment.html page for linking to assignment items described in Assignment and Report Specifications</b></h1>
  <p><br></p>
  <p>This page is the marking guide to your website that your tutor will use to find your elements. Do not name this page anything other than assignment.html (all lower case) or else we may not be able to find and mark your assignment elements.<span>&nbsp; </span>How
    to use this page:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>upload this assignment.html file in your website directory during part 2.2.2 of Lab 1</li>
    <li>later, link this page to your website's index.html page</li>
    <li>over time, link each assignment task listed below to its location in your website as soon as you have started it</li>
    <li>replace the "notes" paragraph with your notes or delete if you have no notes - your notes will help us understand and mark your site so you should explain things. Maybe you did a task differently from the way we specified it, either because your way
      is better (tell us) or minimally or not at all to fit in with your site's look and feel (tell us) or ... (also tell us). So, for example, a video might spoil the look and feel. What you do is make one anyway, link to it from this assessment.html
      page and explain in the <i>Notes</i> why it's not linked to from your public version of your web site. You can style this page as your like, so long as you keep the links to the assignment tasks.</li>
    <li>provide details for your best student forums posts where indicated</li>
    <li>provide the date you attended the continuous improvement session where indicated</li>
    <li>provide link to report where indicated</li>
    <li>delete these instructions when you are ready</li>
  </ul>
  <p><br></p>
  <h1><b>1.0 Part 1 Tasks</b></h1>
  <h2><b>1.2 Your <i>Me and My Passion</i></b></h2>
  <p>http://partch.anu.edu.au.virtual.anu.edu.au/~u6409914/index.html#work http://partch.anu.edu.au.virtual.anu.edu.au/~u6409914/index.html#blog</p>
  <p>Notes: Given the adapted theme from initial assignment requirements, the passion is equivalent to my career hence the blog post previews and previous work are equivalent to my writing about them.</p>
  <h2><b>1.3 CSS</b></h2>
  <p>http://partch.anu.edu.au.virtual.anu.edu.au/~u6409914/resources/styles/main.css</p>
  <p>Notes: Provide any notes you may have about this element here.</p>
  <h2><b>1.4 Site Map</b></h2>
  <p>http://partch.anu.edu.au.virtual.anu.edu.au/~u6409914/site-map.html</p>
  <p>Styled poorly due to lack of thought at start on how it will look on mobile etc and lack of ideas. However, it's responsive with a description of the page before you go to it. So you press the section you're interested in, the page preview will populate
    and then press go to go to the page.</p>
  <h2><b>1.5 Source Log</b></h2>
  <p>http://partch.anu.edu.au.virtual.anu.edu.au/~u6409914/source-log.html</p>
  <p>Notes: Provide any notes you may have about this element here.</p>
  <h2><b>1.6 Feedback Form</b></h2>
  <p>http://partch.anu.edu.au.virtual.anu.edu.au/~u6409914/index.html#contact </p>
  <p>Notes: Feedback form has been replaced by a contact form to ask me questions about my work or hire me due to the theme of site</p>
  <h2><b>1.7 This Assessment Page</b></h2>
  <p>http://partch.anu.edu.au.virtual.anu.edu.au/~u6409914/assessment.html</p>
  <p>Notes: Provide any notes you may have about this element here.</p>

  <h1><b>2.0 Part 2 Tasks</b></h1>
  <h2><b>2.1 Image Map</b></h2>
  <p>http://partch.anu.edu.au.virtual.anu.edu.au/~u6409914/imagemap.html</p>
  <p>Notes: I didn't want the image map to be on my main page as it would ruin the aesthetic. Therefore, I put it on another page. The image map is of a project I recently completed. The project had multiple phases, hence I thought an image detailing the
    phases which links to different parts of the page based on which phase you select would be appropriate.
  </p>
  <h2><b>2.2 Photo Gallery</b></h2>
  <p>http://partch.anu.edu.au.virtual.anu.edu.au/~u6409914/index.html</p>
  <p>Notes: The image gallery contains images of the new project I just completed.</p>

  <h2><b>2.3 & 2.4 Javascript</b></h2>
  <p>I am doing javascript </p>
  <p>Notes: I decided to go for a gallery to showcase my 'featured project' on my page</p>
  <h2><b>2.3 Javascript addition</b></h2>
  <p>http://partch.anu.edu.au.virtual.anu.edu.au/~u6409914/index.html</p>
  <p>Javascript was relevant to my use case due to the fact that this website is showcasing what I can do. So having a custom image gallery for a featured project at the top is a good way to illustrate different parts of my project without overloading my
    website's visual space with images. </p>
  <h2><b>Well written Javascript</b></h2>
  <p>http://partch.anu.edu.au.virtual.anu.edu.au/~u6409914/resources/scripts/gallery.js</p>
  <p>Notes: The script I wrote excels in the following critereon:
    <ul>
      <li><b>Portability</b> : The script is portable in the sense that you can use it on any website that has a galleryPreview, image-title and preview tiles elements. Furthermore, it doesn't need any dependencies to run which is a massive positive for portability.</li>
      <li><b>Performance</b> : The script is lightweight to reduce high resource consumption from solutions that utilize external libraries such as JQuery to run. </li>
      <li><b>Readability</b> : The script has been designed to be very readable with clear variable names, modular functions instead a string of unorganised calls. Furthermore, each function is heavily commented with a description.</li>
      <li><b>Extendability</b> : The script is extendable as I have written my functins to do basics like switching an image by index. These foundational functions make it easier to extend the script to do more as I have already done with tile generation
        for example. Additionally I am using ES6 Javascript Syntax with anonymous functions, ${} data binding and good variable etiquette with let and const where context is not relevant which should be less likely to be deprecated in the future.</li>
    </ul>
