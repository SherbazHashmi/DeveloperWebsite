            <h2>Reflection on what I have learned about web design when creating the site</h2>
            <div class="row">
            <p>
                I started this assignment knowing a lot about web development, I had worked as a part time full stack developer for a while
                and was taking the course as I didn't have any other options as I had messed the order of the subjects I took in my first year up.
                To be honest, I did not expect to learn much from the course, let alone any insightful content about HTML and CSS and that
                was mostly true (with the exception of tables). Hence, I decided to use this course as a chance to push my own knowledge further. In creating the social media Twitter feed and my GitHub feed I learned how
                to deploy a NodeJS server onto Amazon Web Services which was awesome. Furthermore, I also learned a lot more about utilizing the DOM functions instead of using
                a Javascript framework like AureliaJS to generate HTML elements which was good.

                    I can definitely do a lot of things differently in the future when I continue to develop this website. Some ideas I have to improve it is
                    incorporate the VARK learning type knowledge I have gained in this course into my web design. I think having little puzzles for kinaesthetic learners would be a good start.
                    Furthermore, for the visual learners utilizing more CSS animation would be a good idea too. It would allow for the website to stand out and help them focus. One cool design
                    I have seen around the internet is having element float to the center of the screen as you scroll and that would be a good addition I feel. I don't think it would be a good idea to
                    have any music playing for learners who favour audio, however, incorporating an video element into the website talking about my projects might be a good idea to help them out.
